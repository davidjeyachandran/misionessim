# FasterWeb Drupal 7 module

Turn on web performance. Turn your Drupal site into an SPA (Single Page Application).

> We believe that **anyone**, **anywhere** with **any device** should be able to access the information they need... **instantly**.

Enable the FasterWeb module and your website users will experience webpages that open instantly, after the first page load.

## How to use it?

- `composer require drupal/fasterweb`
- Enable the FasterWeb module
- Open the website in Incognito mode (as an anonymous user)

Initially as you click links, the page load will be slow, as FasterWeb learns how you use the website. In less than a minute, you'll notice that links open instantly. Use the Chrome Inspector console to see which links are prefetched.

## Configuration

We're working to make the module as close to Zero config as we can. We have some basic config in the module's js/scripts.js file in the variable (websiteConfig). You can exclude urls here (eg. we have a React App embedded on some pages that don't play with FasterWeb) or if it's simpler you can include urls that FasterWeb will work on.

- urlExclude
- urlInclude

If you have added Javascript on your Drupal site without using Drupal behaviors, these will stop working. You can fix these by adding these as "pageFunctions". An example is a slider you've added on your homepage that is initiated with Javascript. David, the module maintainer, is happy to help in this process.

## How it works?

On page load:

- We intelligently prefech the pages the user is most likely to click on
- We load these pages using AJAX and store the HTML in memory

When the user clicks on a link, if we have the HTML:

- we apply this HTML (using a DOM tree diff between the current page HTML and the target page HTML)

It works based because we know that:

- human behaviour on a website is generally predictable
- loading HTML via AJAX is fast
- minimising DOM changes using a diff is fast

##Will it work on my site?
The FasterWeb module will work on standard Drupal pages. The module creates a JS click event that may conflict with your own page's JS functionality - especially if they haven't been setup using Drupal.behaviours. The module is not an all or nothing solution. Using the module's configuration you can exclude pages that cause conflict. It's better that 90% of pages are accelerated using the FasterWeb module than none. If there is JS code that hasn't been included using Drupal.behaviours, they can be added to the FasterWeb configuration eg. run jQuery("#homeslider").bxSlider()

## FasterWeb service (non-Drupal)

The FasterWeb module connects to an external FasterWeb service. Analytics for every link clicked are sent to the FasterWeb service. We use this information to intelligently predict where future users are likely to click. We will NEVER share or sell this information and we do not fingerprint users. This is the information that is sent:

- sessionKey (random hash)
- country (for statistics)
- current url
- target url
- time to load HTML
- time to apply target page
- Cache Hit?

## Cost

At some point, if we can add signicant value over other services, I'd like to charge for the backend service. However keeping it free for:

- personal sites
- Drupal community sites

## Components of the solution

- Drupal module + Javascript configuration
- Javascript Library (fasterweb.js)
- Server side for suggesting pages that need to be prefetched

## Why try FasterWeb?

- Most bang for your buck and your time. Nothing else will help get your users sub-second page loads, anywhere and on any device.
- FasterWeb complements other web performance tools/services - Drupal caching, CDNs, image and other front-end optimizations
